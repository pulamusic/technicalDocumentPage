# A Technical Documentation Page

This is another [front-end project for freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page). It documents absolutely nothing, designed to demonstrate my ability to use HTML and CSS. Please don't take this as a guide to guitar maintenance.
